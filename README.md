Improvement that needs to be made:
- [X] Make a restart button
- [X] Improve home page/landing page
- [X] Making the game faster as it goes on to make it more challenging
- [X] Customize asset
- [X] Store highscore
- [X] Fix the background bug


Marking Scheme that needs to be reviewed:
- [X] 3D Modelling
- Used FBXLoader to load and configure the "Punk.fbx" model, added it to the scene, and played animations using AnimationMixer.
- [X] Transformation/Camera
- this.mesh.scale, this.mesh.position and this.mesh.quaternion in world.js and background.js.
- Setting camera position in 3D space and defining the point the camera is looking at (in main.js).
- THREE.Vector3 in player.js.
- [X] Lighting
- THREE.HemisphereLight and THREE.DirectionalLight in main.js.
- [X] Textures
- Load using TextureLoader and assigns it to the materials of a 3D model (in background.js and world.js).
